                I appreciate your interest. Let me provide you with a brief
                overview of myself as a developer.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="delay-1 anim-fade-from-right">
                I am passionate about web development and enjoy transforming
                ideas into reality. For me, coding is not just a job but a
                creative instrument where I can continually improve and
                challenge myself.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="delay-2 anim-fade-from-left">
                Although I self-studied web development for many years prior, I
                have recently completed my formal studies, graduating from
                Falmouth University in Computing (BSc Hons, first). During my
                academic journey, I consolidated my programming concepts and
                gained hands-on experience in various technologies and
                languages, such as Python or C#.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="delay-3 anim-fade-from-right">
                However, my passion lies in web development. I have been
                creating projects in JavaScript and MERN (Mongo, Express, React,
                NodeJs) since 2017, and I continued to work on my side projects
                even during my years in college and university.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="delay-2 anim-fade-from-left">
                I am excited to apply my skills and contribute to a dynamic
                development team. If my profile aligns with your requirements
                and you feel I would be a good fit for your team, I would be
                thrilled to discuss further details. Please don't hesitate to
                contact me.
