                As you may have guessed, I love involving myself in technology
                and coding-related activities. However, my personality is not
                one-sided. I am interested in many things not concerning
                computing, such as modern history and geopolitics, languages and
                etymology, and I enjoy playing the guitar, callisthenics
                training and martial arts.
